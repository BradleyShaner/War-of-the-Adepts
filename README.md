# War of the Adepts
 WOTA VB6 Source, client and server

I didn't want this to be lost to time, so I dug up the source and here it is. This old VB6 multiplayer game was created by IKK (IKillKenny) of https://gsa.doc-ent.com and I spent many hours playing it as a kid. I don't think I got it fully working aafter the source was leaked many years later, but I recall fixing many issues and getting it to a login-able state. We're talking at least 10 years ago, and the game is nearly 17 years old? Ah, well, either way here it shall be enshrined forever more.
